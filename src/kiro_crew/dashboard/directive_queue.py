"""Provider-neutral delivery for session directives.

The directive marker (:mod:`kiro_crew.session_directive`) is model-visible text,
so the consumer may only honour it when the tool CALL it arrived under was
recorded as an MCP call served by Kiro Crew's own core server. That recording
comes from the provider's out-of-band ``_meta.kiro`` channel, which is a
kiro-cli engine feature: an ACP backend that does not emit it leaves the gate
with no trusted source, and a gate with no trusted source correctly refuses
every directive. The whole control plane (loops, project changes, cards) then
fails closed on that backend — silently, until #6970 added the diagnostic.

This module is the second delivery path, and it carries the payload OUT OF BAND
rather than through the model's tool result. The MCP tool, having validated its
arguments, POSTs them to the gateway over Kiro Crew's own internal API declaring
its ``X-Session-Key``; the gateway parks the record here; the turn's consumer
claims it. The marker is still emitted (the kiro-cli path is unchanged and
remains authoritative there), but on a backend without ``_meta.kiro`` the marker
is reduced to a HINT that a record may be waiting — its CONTENT is never read.

Why this is not weaker than the marker gate it backs up
------------------------------------------------------
TWO channels must agree, and neither is trusted alone. That is the whole design:

* The RECORD carries the payload and is unforgeable in CONTENT — it is what the
  tool validated, delivered out of band, never lifted from model-visible text.
  Its weak point is its TARGET: the session is named by an ``X-Session-Key``
  header, and the header is only kernel-attested on an AF_UNIX peer whose /proc
  ancestry resolves. Over TCP loopback (Windows has no AF_UNIX at all), or from a
  pooled backend whose ancestry does not resolve, a same-uid caller holding the
  internal secret could name somebody else's session.
* The MARKER is bound to the right session by construction — it arrives inside
  the tool result of a call made in THAT turn, on that session's own event
  stream. Its weak point is CONTENT: it is model-visible text, so a model can
  type one.
* So a directive applies only where BOTH hold: :func:`claim` requires a parked
  record whose ``(kind, args)`` equal the ones the frame's marker names, parked
  during the CLAIMING turn. A record aimed at another session waits for a marker
  that session's model never emits; a forged marker looks up a record that no
  tool ever validated. The applied payload is always the RECORD's, so the marker
  never contributes a value — only the choice of which record to look up.

A model can still drive its OWN session by publishing and marking honestly, which
is exactly what calling the tool does. No privilege is gained.

Deliberately NOT persisted. A directive is turn-scoped: the turn that requested
it is what gives it meaning. Surviving a gateway restart would let a loop arm, or
a project change land, against a turn that no longer exists — so records live in
memory and are additionally dropped on age.

In-memory means the store has to be bounded in BOTH dimensions, and the reclaim
runs on PUBLISH because for most sessions there is no read path at all: only the
dashboard consumer claims, while the messaging ``TurnDriver`` applies directives
from the verified marker and never calls in here. Records expire by age
(:data:`MAX_AGE_SECS`), a bucket is capped (:data:`MAX_PER_SESSION`), and a bucket
whose records have all expired is DELETED rather than left empty — so the map
holds only sessions that published recently, with :data:`MAX_SESSIONS` as the
backstop for a burst inside one expiry window.
