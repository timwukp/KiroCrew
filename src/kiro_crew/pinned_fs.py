"""Descriptor-pinned filesystem staging: open once, then never trust a name again.

Every function here exists because guarding a path by NAME does not guard the open
that follows it. A name is validated, then re-opened, and in the window between the
two anything running as this user -- which in this product includes an agent -- can
swap the final component, or an ancestor DIRECTORY, for a link pointing somewhere
else. The validated path and the opened inode are then not the same thing.

The discipline is one sentence: resolve once, open once, and address everything
downstream through the descriptor you already hold. A descriptor cannot be
re-pointed, so a component that is open is fixed; a component reached by name is
not.

Why this module exists rather than a check at each call site: two closed pull
requests (#2446, #2447) tried to add snapshot components while hardening staging in
the same change. Each review round named one more validated-by-name path use --
source root, each ancestor, each file, the destination tree, the pre-restore backup
pass -- and neither converged. The mechanism belongs in one place with one set of
invariants, and callers become thin consumers of it.

The mechanical half of this was first written for the benchmark harness in
``kiro_crew.eval.bench.safepath``, which now imports it from here. Its invariants
survived several rounds of review there and are preserved verbatim; the docstrings
explaining WHY each flag is load-bearing came with them.

Two things this module deliberately does NOT do:

* It holds no policy. It does not know which locations are protected, and it does
  not decide whether a refusal should abort a command or be reported and skipped.
  Callers pass their own refusal type (so an existing CLI error contract does not
  change) and their own ``on_skip`` reporter (so user-facing wording stays theirs).
* It does not silently substitute a weaker mechanism. Where a platform cannot pin
  (see :func:`supports_pinned_walk`), the caller is told so and decides; nothing
  here falls back to a by-name walk on its own.

    With *must_create* a name that already exists is REFUSED rather than accepted. Review
    found the hole that needs: a replace removes the live tree and stages the archive into
    its place, so if the gateway recreates that root in between, accepting it lets files
    the archive does not contain survive a "replace" that reports success. The children
    already refused a pre-existing name -- only the root was exempt, and this makes it
    consistent. Merge callers leave it false, because meeting an existing directory is
    what merging IS.

    This used to also report whether our own `mkdir` was what created the directory, so
    that the archive's mode and timestamps could be stamped on in that case only. That
    flag is gone, and the reasoning that justified it was wrong in an instructive way.

    It was correct that sampling `dst.exists()` beforehand is a name-based check with a
    window after it. What it missed is that `mkdir` succeeding does not close the window
    either: the descriptor comes from a SEPARATE `open`, so a directory replaced between
    the two leaves the flag true while describing an object the caller no longer holds --
    and the archive's metadata then lands on somebody else's directory. Review found
    that. Nothing repairs it: a stat taken after the `mkdir` observes the replacement
    just as happily, POSIX has no atomic create-and-open for a directory, and under a
    same-user threat model no mode trick helps. So the metadata is simply not applied to
    directories, and the flag has no remaining purpose.

    ``Path(p).mkdir(parents=True)`` creates every missing component by name, so a link
    already sitting at an ancestor is followed and the directories are created inside
    whatever it points at -- a write through an attacker-controlled path, which is
    strictly worse than a read through one. Review flagged the by-name creation; the
    probe that settled it showed a link AT the final component is already refused by
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` but an ancestor link is not.

    So the parent chain is pinned first and only the final component is created,
    relative to that descriptor. What remains is this module's documented and
    deliberate residual, stated in :func:`pin_parent`: a component that was already a
    link when the parent was resolved is followed by that resolution, because refusing
    every symlinked ancestor would break a destination under ``/tmp`` on macOS. The
    parent must therefore already exist -- callers create their own tree roots.

    never fires because what it finds inside the replaced tree is a plain regular

    the directory that was validated is exactly the directory used. Both roots go

    swapped there lands the archive's bytes outside it. Caught in review.

    With *skip_existing* an occupied destination name is reported and skipped rather
    than refused, which is what a merge that must not overwrite needs. Without it an

    Records the inode of every entry, keyed by components relative to the scan root, plus
    every LINK's key separately. Children are opened relative to the descriptor with
    ``O_NOFOLLOW``, so no path is resolved and a directory that is really a link is not
    descended into. The inodes come from the directory block itself
    (``os.DirEntry.inode``), so recording them costs no extra syscall.

    The inodes are the point. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refuses a LINK, but a real directory RENAMED
    into a scanned name is not a link and satisfies ``O_DIRECTORY`` -- so moving a live
    directory onto a scanned directory's name redirects later unlinks at live files that
    happen to share a name, and pinning the ROOT does not cover that, because the root's
    own inode is unchanged by a rename inside it. Every directory a removal later opens
    must be the inode this scan recorded. A map read at removal time cannot serve: it
    reports the impostor.

    Refuses an entry on another ``device``, which is how a mount arriving underneath is
    caught: it is not a link either.

    ITERATIVE, with an explicit stack, because a recursive walk of a deeply nested tree
    raises ``RecursionError`` -- which is not ``OSError``, so it escapes callers that turn
    a failed read into a refusal.

    What it costs in descriptors, stated accurately because the obvious guess is wrong: a
    directory's child directories are ALL opened before any of them is visited, so what is
    held at once is the queued frontier, not the current path. A wide tree can therefore
    exhaust descriptors as easily as a deep one. Both surface as ``EMFILE`` -- an ``OSError``
    every caller here already treats as "cannot read this, keep it" -- so the failure is
    contained either way; only the arithmetic differs. Files and links cost nothing, which is
    what makes this bearable in practice: the trees this walks are wide in FILES and narrow
    in directories.

    Opening children eagerly is deliberate rather than incidental. Each child's inode is
    taken from the directory block and cross-checked against the ``fstat`` of the descriptor
    opened a moment later, and that pair is what catches a directory renamed into a scanned
    name between the listing and the open. Deferring the open until the child is visited
    would put every sibling's processing inside that window, trading a documented containment
    property for a descriptor bound. The bound is the thing worth giving up.

    Raises rather than returning a short list: this feeds decisions about deleting the only
    copy of something, so an incomplete answer must not read as "nothing unaccounted for".

    *expect* is ``(st_dev, st_ino)``. This is the single owner of rename-verify-remove.
    ``rmdir`` addresses a NAME and so does any check above it, so an actor with write
    access to the parent can swap the name between the two and have an unapproved
    directory removed on another one's approval. So:

    1. the name is renamed to ``.<name>.removing-<random>`` in the SAME parent, which is
       atomic and moves whatever holds the name somewhere only this call knows;
    2. the identity is re-checked THERE, through the parent descriptor, against *expect*;
    3. only that staging name is removed.

    The suffix is random because ``os.rename`` replaces an existing destination silently on
    POSIX: a predictable name is one that can be squatted.

    The rename BACK is the part that is easy to get wrong, so both halves are stated.

    On a MISMATCH it never happens: the object under the staging name is not the one that
    was approved, which means the name it came from is not this code's to write to either --
    and rename replaces its destination, so putting the impostor back would destroy whatever
    now answers to the original name.

    On a failed ``rmdir`` it happens only if the original name is FREE. It has to be put back
    where it can be found: this directory could not be removed because something is inside
    it, and that something is unaccounted-for content nobody listed -- leaving it under an
    unguessable name means nothing can point at it again. But POSIX rename REPLACES a
    directory destination when that destination is an empty directory, so renaming back
    blindly can silently remove one a concurrent writer created at the name. Checking the
    name is free first is a check-to-use pair, and this module says elsewhere that those are
    the mistake it exists to remove -- so what it does and does not buy is worth being exact
    about. There is no no-replace rename for directories in the stdlib (``renameat2``'s
    ``RENAME_NOREPLACE`` is Linux-only and unexposed), so the choice is between this and one
    of two unconditional losses. What the check removes is the DETERMINISTIC case, where
    something already holds the name by the time the removal fails; what is left is a race
    inside two adjacent syscalls whose worst outcome is an empty directory removed, which
    holds no data and is trivially remade. A name found occupied leaves the directory staged
    and reported.

    Never raises for these outcomes and never logs: the caller decides between
    log-and-continue and raise, and words the message. ``error`` carries the underlying
    ``OSError`` for a caller that re-raises.

    """Recreate *dst_name* inside *dst_dir_fd* from *src_name*, refusing to replace anything.

    The undo half of "move an entry aside, remove the tree, put it back if the tree would
    not go". It has to be no-clobber: something may have arrived at *dst_name* while the
    entry was out, and that something is a file this code has never read.

    *src_name* is treated as UNTRUSTED, which is the part that is easy to skip. It is a name
    in a directory an actor may be able to write to, and the whole reason this function runs
    is that an earlier step already failed -- so time has passed. The name is opened
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and its inode checked against *expect_ino* before anything is read from
    it, and the copy reads that DESCRIPTOR rather than re-opening the name. Without that, a
    name swapped for a symbolic link is followed and whatever it points at -- a credential,
    say -- is linked or copied into the destination under a name the caller will treat as its
    own.

    First choice is ``os.link``, which cannot clobber, and it is called with
    ``follow_symlinks=False`` so a swap landing after the verification links the link itself
    rather than its target. What LANDED is then checked by inode too, because that link is
    still addressed by name.

    Where hard links are unsupported there is no second no-clobber RENAME in the stdlib --
    ``renameat2``'s ``RENAME_NOREPLACE`` is Linux-only and unexposed -- and the two obvious
    substitutes are each a documented loss:

    * ``rename`` after checking the name is free puts a check-to-use window between the look
      and the act, so a file arriving in between is replaced. That is the same
      trusted-a-name mistake this module exists to remove.
    * giving up leaves the tree holding data with nothing that lists it: unreachable and
      unrecoverable.

    ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` is the third option and has neither flaw. The create either wins or
    fails with ``EEXIST``, decided inside one syscall, so nothing can arrive in a window;
    and it needs no hard-link support, so it strands nothing. The cost is a copy rather than
    a link, paid only on a filesystem without links and only when a removal already failed.

    Note WHY the copy path cannot be skipped by probing first: ``os.link in
    os.supports_dir_fd`` tests whether the OS accepts ``dir_fd``, not what the MOUNT
    supports, so a filesystem without hard links passes that probe and then refuses the
    call. A guard built on the probe is a guard that fails exactly where it matters.

    """Remove the directory *resolved_path* and everything in it, by descriptor throughout.

    The whole-tree counterpart of the pieces above, for callers whose answer to "what may
    be deleted here" is "all of it" -- a directory they have already established holds
    nothing worth keeping. What it replaces at those call sites is
    ``shutil.rmtree(path)``, which re-resolves the path: every ancestor is walked again by
    the kernel, so one of them swapped to a link after the caller's own checks is followed
    and the removal lands outside the tree entirely.

    The sequence: pin the parent chain one ``openat`` per component, open the target
    through it with ``O_NOFOLLOW``, scan it once, let *approve* look at what was found,
    remove links and files against the scanned inodes, remove directories deepest-first
    through :func:`remove_dir_verified`, re-scan to decide whether it is actually empty,
    and only then remove the target itself -- verified against the descriptor the whole
    operation was pinned to.

    *approve* is where a caller re-establishes, THROUGH THE PINNED DESCRIPTOR, whatever it
    believes about this directory. It is called once with ``(root_fd, tree)`` before
    anything is removed, and returning a reason string refuses the whole removal having
    touched nothing. It is not optional decoration. Resolving the parent does NOT by itself
    prove the opened directory is the caller's, because ``Path.resolve()`` follows an
    ancestor that is ALREADY a link -- so a swap landing before the resolve produces a
    perfectly pinned walk to the wrong tree, and pinning alone would then delete it. What
    defeats that is the caller asking a question only its own directory can answer, and
    asking it of the descriptor rather than of the path.

    It has NO DEFAULT for that reason. ``approve=None`` is a real option -- a caller with
    genuinely nothing to check gets containment only for a swap landing AFTER the resolve --
    but it is the weaker mode, and a keyword with a default makes the weaker mode what you
    get by not thinking about it. Writing ``approve=None`` is a caller stating the choice,
    which is the same reason ``must_create`` on :func:`create_and_open_dir_pinned` is stated
    rather than derived.

    *keep_until_empty* names a top-level FILE to remove LAST, and it exists because the
    order is load-bearing rather than tidy. Some trees are only DISCOVERABLE through one
    entry -- an index, a manifest -- and removing that first means a later failure leaves
    the rest of the tree on disk with nothing that lists it: data neither visible nor
    recoverable, while the removal reported a partial success. So the named entry is skipped
    by the file pass, the closing scan must find nothing but it, and only then is it moved
    aside and the tree removed. If the tree still will not go, the entry goes back through
    :func:`put_back_no_clobber`, which cannot overwrite whatever arrived at that name and
    needs no hard-link support to succeed.

    Raises *refusal* on a platform that cannot pin (see
    :func:`supports_pinned_tree_walk`) rather than falling back to a by-name removal. That
    is this module's standing rule: the caller is told and decides. It also raises
    *refusal* when the target cannot be opened at all, which is precisely the ancestor swap
    the pinned walk exists to catch.

    Returns rather than raises for a tree that would not go: ``removed`` is False and
    ``survivors`` says how much is left, so a caller can keep the directory visible instead
    of reporting a success that did not happen.

    *resolved_path* must already be RESOLVED -- see :func:`pin_parent` for why demanding
    that is safe rather than brittle.

    """Move the deferred entry out, remove the now-empty tree, then delete the entry.

    The entry and the directory have to go TOGETHER, and ``rmdir`` cannot run while the
    entry is still in there. Unlinking it first leaves a window that a file created after
    the closing scan turns into silent loss: the ``rmdir`` then fails on a non-empty
    directory, and the tree - now without the entry that made it discoverable - is data on
    disk that nothing lists.

    So the entry is MOVED to the parent under an unguessable debris name instead of deleted.
    From there the tree can be removed, and if that fails the entry goes straight back,
    leaving it discoverable exactly as it was. A crash between the two renames leaves one
    small file rather than an unreadable tree.

    The way back is :func:`put_back_no_clobber`, never ``rename``: POSIX rename REPLACES its
    destination silently, which is the property the debris name is chosen to be safe
    against, and this direction needs the opposite - a file that arrived at the entry's name
    in the interval must not be clobbered. The debris is unlinked only once the entry is
    back, so no window has neither.
