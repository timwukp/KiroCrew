class TestTheAncestorWalkStopsAtTheSystemTempRootNotUnderIt:
    """A real regression, caught by CI and not by any local run: this project's OWN
    test suite pins `KIROCREW_HOME` under `/tmp` for isolation
    (`testing-conventions`), and the unbounded ancestor walk added two rounds ago
    reached bare `/tmp` and treated it as a protected container -- refusing every
    command naming it, `cd /tmp && cat notes.txt` included. Invisible locally because
    nothing in a bare `pytest` invocation sets `KIROCREW_HOME` at all.

    The fix is not "stop the walk at the first ancestor that happens to be under
    `/tmp`" -- that overshoots and un-protects every INTERMEDIATE ancestor between the
    leaf and `/tmp`, silently reopening the exact gap the walk exists to close. It has
    to stop EXACTLY at the temp root itself, the same exact-match shape the
    `Path.home()` stop already has.

    The stop is asymmetric between the two mechanisms, on review feedback: the
    command gate (`security.py`) is verb-independent text matching, so reaching the
    temp root there refuses every command merely NAMING it -- it has to stop early.
    The sandbox self-bind (`sandbox.py`) costs nothing comparable -- it denies
    RENAMING one literal directory entry, nothing else -- so it keeps walking through
    the temp root, protecting a `KIROCREW_HOME` nested under a user- or
    environment-selected `$TMPDIR` from having THAT boundary itself relocated.
