"""Close-vs-recreate race on the shared dashboard slot-close teardown.

The defect these pin (issue #7191): both ``api_chat_slot_delete`` and
``api_chat_slots_cleanup`` pop ``name`` out of ``state._slots`` and then run a
sequence of AWAITS — cancel the task, ``save_slot_off_loop(..., closed=True)``,
``state.sessions.remove(_history_key_for(name))``. A concurrent same-key
recreate (a POST /api/chat, or the session_close MCP verb) can mint a
REPLACEMENT slot for the same key inside that window. The original, still in
flight, then (a) writes ITS transcript over the shared history key as closed and
(b) tears down the session the replacement now uses. The failure arms compound
it: they blindly ``state._slots[name] = <original>`` over whatever now owns the
key.

The fix re-checks identity — ``_slot_still_ours``, i.e. no DIFFERENT object owns
``name`` — before the closed=True save and again before ``sessions.remove``, at
BOTH sites, and guards the failure-arm restores so they never clobber a live
replacement. These tests interleave a recreate across the teardown awaits (via an
``asyncio.Event`` the monkeypatched ``save_slot_off_loop`` parks on) and assert
the replacement's identity, history, and session survive, and that the
destructive step was skipped. Each would FAIL if its guard were reverted.

The predicate's polarity is pinned on its own, because getting it backwards is
silent: an absent key is the ORDINARY post-pop state, so a guard reading
``get(name) is <popped>`` would fire on EVERY close and skip the teardown it
exists to protect — leaking the per-tab session and never persisting the closed
transcript, with a 200 either way. The two ``ordinary`` tests below and
``test_still_ours_treats_a_freed_key_as_ours`` are that pin.
